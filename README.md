# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

## Javascript - Jest

### Add the missing tests

1. Initial - create item, create shop with items, create shop without items
2. Updating Quality - quality increases and decreases per specified parameters

### Refactor the code

Consider:

- Use variables for thresholds and typical increases/decreases & update tests to use variables -
  instructions do not specify typical increase/decrease and it is only inferred from code
- 'Sulfurus' and 'Backstage passes' are both referred to generically instructions but have more
  specific names in code - could there be multiple types of each of these? i.e. 'Backstage passes to
  a TAFKAL80ETC concert' and 'Backstage passes to another event'

### Implement the new feature
